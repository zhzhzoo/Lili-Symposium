Lili-Symposium
==============
Lili Symposium is a group of people talking mathematics and physics.
It was started in May 2014 when Lili was seeking somebody to study
abstract algebra together.

Lili Symposium uses the [issue tracker][issue] of this repository
for discussion. Currently, someone is publishing his solutions to
their algebra textbook's problems here. And if you want to have a
discussion, reply the issues. If you want to propose a topic, start
an issue. However, only collaborators can start or edit an issue,
so, if you are a group member, ask the repository owner to make you
a collaborator.
